1:formula
  formula <power>
  it will calculate how long will the computer take for calculating the program
Example  
$ ./formula 5
(1+x)^5 =1 +5*x^1+10*x^2+10*x^3+5*x^4+1*x^5 Time Required = 50 microsecond


Reading x86 Assembly Code
decipher the Assembly Language program
Example
 $ ./mystery 41
     Value: 165580141
